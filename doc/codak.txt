INTRODUCTION                                                *codak*

Whenever you are editing a function in a git repository, a set of commands is
defined that enable better search and git diff lookups

COMMANDS                                                    *codak-commands*

These commands are local to the buffers in which they work (generally, buffers
that are part of Git repositories).
